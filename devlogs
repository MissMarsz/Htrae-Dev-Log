  # ✨ Devlog 01 - April 28, 2025
    
Welcome to the devlog for Htrae!
I'll post updates about progress, major changes, ideas, and milestones here!
    
Today I started setting up the base for my 2D top-down sandbox game!  
Players will explore islands, build villages, and survive as animals in a world where humans are hostile mobs.

## Progress
- ✅ Basic player movement coded
- ✅ First test tilemap created
- ✅ Set up GitHub project and first devlog!

## Challenges
- Linking animation scenes and setting up test files took some trial and error.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create composting/farming system for expanding islands
- [ ] Add basic placeholder mobs (hostile humans)
